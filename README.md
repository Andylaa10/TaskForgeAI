In modern project management, accurately breaking down high-level tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks and estimating their time is crucial for efficient planning and resource allocation. 

To address this challenge, this project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of automating the task decomposition process. Given a high-level task from a file source, the agent will break it down into smaller subtasks, estimate the time and cost required for each subtask, and leverage tools to gather relevant information for these estimations. The agent will further integrate with GitHub Projects to create and organize the subtasks, enabling seamless tracking and collaboration.
