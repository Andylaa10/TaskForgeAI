# Introduction - TaskForge AI

In modern project management, accurately breaking down high-level tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks and estimating their time is crucial for efficient planning and resource allocation. 

To address this challenge, this project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of automating the task decomposition process. Given a high-level task from a file source, the agent will break it down into smaller subtasks, estimate the time and cost required for each subtask, and leverage tools to gather relevant information for these estimations. The agent will further integrate with GitHub Projects to create and organize the subtasks, enabling seamless tracking and collaboration.

## Setup

Clone and save the project

<br/>

Navigate to the root of the project.

```bash
cd TaskForgeAI
```

Install the Python dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br/>

Create your own .env file in the root of the project

Give it the following API-keys: 

```
GITHUB_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

To get the GITHUB_API_KEY, go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a Personal Access Token (PAT) or use an existing one.

To get the OPENAI_API_KEY, go to: https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/ and create a new API Key or use an existing one.

## Run the agent

Run the main.py file:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Requirements

- Python v3.10+ (v3.12 preferred)
- AutoGen
- Ollama
- fix-busted-json
- requests
- python-dotenv
- mistralai
- autogen-agentchat @ git+https://github.com/patrickstolc/autogen.git@0.2#egg=autogen-agentchat (custom fix for ratelimiting using the free Mistral AI)

## Input

The TaskForge AI functions via a given high level task. Given a task, it will then split it into preferrably smaller subtasks. 
To provide the TaskForge AI with a task, the `task.txt` file should be filled with a descriptive task. 

As an example, lets give it the following task: 
```
Develop a scientific calculator functionality in an already existing React Native "Multi Tool" App.
```

## Output

From the given task above, a series of outputs are responded back in forth from the AI and the UserProxy in the following way: 

<br/> 

### - read_task_from_file function execution

<br/> 
<br/> 

### - project_name & subtasks outputted as JSON

<br/> 
<br/> 

### - create_project function execution (returning project_id)

<br/> 
<br/> 

At last (if succesfully run), the AI should terminate itself and you should be left with a newly create GitHub Project, with the tasks generated by the TaskForge AI.
